# ternary-fabric

This repository defines a ternary-native memory and interconnect fabric for accelerating compression, signal processing, and AI workloads inside binary-dominated systems. It formalizes how balanced-ternary data frames, vector lanes, and execution units coexist with conventional binary control, storage, and I/O planes without attempting to replace them.
