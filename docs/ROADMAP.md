# 🧭 Strategy Roadmap — Device-Level Fabric Acceleration

The Ternary Fabric project implements a "Fabric Illusion" where the accelerator acts as a semantic memory and compute substrate, transparently offloading AI workloads from a binary host.

- Deliverable: `tile_mask` support in execution kernels.

### Phase 12: PyTorch Integration ✅
- "Fabric Illusion" support for high-level deep learning frameworks.
- Deliverable: `TFMBSLinear` module and autograd functions.

- Deliverable: T-GEMM, T-Conv3D, T-LSTM, and T-Attention RTL.

### Phase 18: Workload Maturation & Measurement ✅
- Establishing a rigorous three-tier benchmark plane and cost model.
- Deliverable: **Fabric Cost** and **Economic Efficiency** KPIs.

### Phase 19: Data-Driven Adaptation ✅
- Using metrics to drive autonomous scheduling and hysteresis.
- Deliverable: `economic_metrics.csv` and cost-aware scheduling.

### Phase 20: Learning & Self-Tuning ✅
- Hill-climbing feedback loops for cost coefficients and batch sizes.
- Deliverable: Adaptive scheduler weighting and eviction priorities.

### Phase 21: Predictive Multi-Fabric Orchestration ✅
- System-level management across multiple isolated Fabric Instances.
- Deliverables:
  - **Global Orchestrator:** Dynamic task distribution.
  - **Predictive Scheduler:** 5-kernel lookahead mechanism.
  - **Cross-Fabric Fusion:** Dependency-aware locality optimization.
  - **Three-Stage Pipeline:** Pre-fetch -> Execute -> Commit.

## 📝 Discrepancies & Notes
- All phases up to 21 are fully implemented in the emulator.
- Physical hardware synthesis (Phase 15/21) is verified against the XC7Z020 target.
- Hardware path (Phase 10) remains in "Mock" state for host-side verification.
